        <h1>The Internet of Things</h1>
        <h2>Security and privacy concerns – What can we do?</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things" target="_blank" title="Open link in new tab: &#13;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">The Internet of Things</a> is slowly becoming one of those things we in the modern world take for granted, like water in the faucet and electric lamps. Smartphones have been online for what feels like decades followed by tablet pc’s, smart watches, children’s toys, baby monitors, surveillance equipment, washing machines and other home appliances, now even cars! If it runs on electricity, chances are that it has online capability. In a perfect world all these things are great conveniences and rather harmless. Our world however is far from perfect. There is such a huge amount of data gathered from all the gadgets we use in addition to social media that we must assume that we can easily be profiled. Data that is also often processed by AI to provide customized ads etc.</p>
        <p>What happens when data isn’t as anonymous as it should be? What happens when data is sold? Will you be denied health insurance based on a probability list based on your profile? Will you be denied a mortgage based on expected longevity according to your profile? What if less than benign authorities acquire an app with a “gaydar” based on such an algorithm as the one from a study by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000098" target="_blank" title="Open link in new tab: &#13;https://doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000098">Wang, Y., & Kosinski, M. (2018)</a> and implement it to mass usage to persecute and punish? What about
        your political views?</p>
        <p>I cannot help but feel that we have all collectively traded in our privacy for convenience and seeing as we are fortunate enough to live in a peaceful part of the world, we have all, whether aware or not, gambled that our governing state will always be a benign one and have all its citizens best interests in mind. History however has proven otherwise. These might sound like rather pessimistic thoughts, but once you consider the amount of information that is stored about you in one or several servers around the world, one should at least be aware of the possible future implications.</p>
        <p>Neither of us are willing to part with our smartphones or gadgets, however. The only “preventive” measure I can think of as a customer (other than opting out from everything) is not to keep all my eggs in the same basket. Maybe simply not using the same email address everywhere. My Fitbit doesn't need to know how often I order from Foodora, neither does Facebook. I’m certainly not using Facebook to log in anywhere other than Facebook. And Spotify.</p>
