            >
            is slowly becoming one of those things we in the modern world take
            for granted, like water in the faucet and electric lamps.
            Smartphones have been online for what feels like decades followed by
            tablet pc’s, smart watches, children’s toys, baby monitors,
            surveillance equipment, washing machines and other home appliances,
            now even cars! If it runs on electricity, chances are that it has
            online capability. In a perfect world all these things are great
            conveniences and rather harmless. Our world however is far from
            perfect. There is such a huge amount of data gathered from all the
            gadgets we use in addition to social media that we must assume that
            we can easily be profiled. Data that is also often processed by AI
            to provide customised ads etc.</span

          <span
            >What happens when data isn’t as anonymous as it should be? What
            happens when data is sold? Will you be denied health insurance based
            on a probability list based on your profile? Will you be denied a
            mortgage based on expected longevity according to your profile? What
            if less than benign authorities acquire an app with a “gaydar” based
            on such an algorithm as the one from a study by
            <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000098"
              >Wang, Y., & Kosinski, M. (2018)</a
            >
            and implement it to mass usage to persecute and punish? What about
            your political views?</span
          >
          <span
            >I cannot help but feel that we have all collectively traded in our
            privacy for conveniency and seeing as we are fortunate enough to
            live in a peaceful part of the world, we have all, whether aware or
            not, gambled that our governing state will always be a benign one
            and have all its citizens best interests in mind. History however
            has proven otherwise. These might sound like rather pessimistic
            thoughts, but once you consider the amount of information that is
            stored about you in one or several servers around the world, one
            should at least be aware of the possible future implications.

            Neither of us are willing to part with our smartphones or gadgets,
            however. The only “preventive” measure I can think of as a customer
            (other than opting out from everything) is not to keep all my eggs
            in the same basket. Maybe simply not using the same email address
            everywhere. My Fitbit doesn’t need to know how often I order from
            Foodora, neither does Facebook. I’m certainly not using Facebook to
            log in anywhere other than Facebook. And Spotify.</span
