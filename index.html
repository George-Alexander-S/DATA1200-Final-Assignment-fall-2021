            <p>Imagine sitting in the corner of a student cafe, full of young people, who have come to relax with a glass of cheap drinks, after a hard day of listening to a lecture at a nearby college. This is how one afternoon of student life looks like.</p>
            <div class="image-and-text-div">
                <img src="img/placeholder1.jpg" alt="placeholder picture" title="placeholder picture">

            </div>
            <p>Technology has reached almost every corner of our life and has shaped and mad our life-stye easier in so many ways. People with disability would not always agree with this. As future developers, we feel strongly that it is our obligation to give access to everybody on equal basis in use of technology.</p>
            <div class="image-and-text-div">
                <img src="img/placeholder1.jpg" alt="placeholder picture" title="placeholder picture">

            </div>
            <p>Never has technology been as good, and effective as it is today to allow individuals to shape and control our lifestyle. The miracle of technology reflects in everything from Smart Cities, internet of things, artificial intelligence and so one. How this new and powerful technology works, depends on our cooperation as a society to bring the best out of it.</p>
