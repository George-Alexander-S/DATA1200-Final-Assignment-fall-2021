        <p>We as a group come from varying stages of life. Either straight from high-school or having worked for a few years, or several. In our group, we were all fresh coders. Some of us may have dabbled a little with website creation, but not to a large extent.</p>
        <p>Learning to code has been about learning to think in a certain way. It may have seemed somewhat abstract to begin with. However, with time you start to develop a certain way of visualizing the concepts in your code and perceive how the information moves from one part of the code to another. It’s a form of understanding that gradually builds. You might say in some way it’s almost comparable to learning a spoken language. It must be said that we are still in the very beginning of our programming journey, but we are all having fun and seem to be learning at an adequate pace.</p>
        <p>One of the greatest challenges as a student in OsloMet has been the difference in organization and information flow on the different courses. We’ve also had to deal with   WIDELY different forms of lecturing and lecturers. Some seem more efficient than others. We all agree that we would prefer to have more pre-recorded lectures that can be viewed and more importantly, re-viewed at our leisure. Another aspect has been to filter out other sources of information. There is a huge amount of information about computer programming etc on the internet. Naturally not all of it is of equal quality, and not all of it follows the “best practices” of coding. Thus, we’ve had to learn to separate the good from the bad, as well as discover our favorite founts of information.</p>
        <p>Some of us were used to working in groups before we started, and for others it has been a new experience. We seem to have figured out a decent way of working together, though things can always be improved.</p>
        <p>As for managing the workload, that has certainly been challenging at times. Seeing as most of us are new to the subjects we might have gone overboard on some assignments and ended up with less time for others. Delivering sub-par assignments has never been an option, so we’ve just ended up spending a lot of time on school this semester. Based on feedback from senior students, we don’t see how that’s going to change for the coming semesters. It doesn’t get better, but we’ll get used to it so it will at least feel better.</p>
