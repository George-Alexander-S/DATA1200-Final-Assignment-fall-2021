DATA1200 Final Assignment fall 2021
Oslo Metropolitan University
due date: 21.11.2021

Task:
This is the final exam of the DATA1200 Inclusive Web Design course, fall 2021. We are tasked with creating 5 webpages. Excluding the 5th page, we are to focus on web accessibility and maintainable code.
The 5th page (Fun!) will not be judged based on accessibility and therefore, we focused on visual appeal instead. We still focused on well written code for this page.

Licensing:
Unless stated otherwise, all code and images used in this website is created by us.
